# MMHT: object tracking model
We present a comprehensive demonstration of our MMHT model to provide reviewers with an opportunity to assess the reliability of our work. Our supplementary material includes the complete training and test codes. Please note that due to file size constraints, we can only provide an example of our processed dataset. The codes are executed on an Ubuntu 20.04 platform with a Nvidia A100 GPU.

##  Train on FE108 Dataset
1. Change the dataset path at line 6 in 'ltr/admin/local.py'. 
2. Run ``` python train_mmht.py ```. You are free to change the training parameters in 'ltr/train_settings/MMHT/mmht.py'. 

##  Test on FE108 Dataset
1. Change dataset path at line 9 in 'pytracking/evaluation/local.py'.
2. Run ``` python run_tracker_mmht.py ```. You can change test parameters in 'pytracking/parameter/fusion/mmht_para.py'. 

##  Visualization
We present the tracking performance of three models (PrDiMP-SNN, PrDiMP-ResNet18, and MMHT) on four samples extracted from the FE108 and COESOT datasets. The colors of these bounding boxes remain consistent with those showcased in Figure 3 and Figure 4. The ground truth is indicated by the red box.
